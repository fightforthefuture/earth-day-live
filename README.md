# Earth Day Live [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/fightforthefuture/earth-day-live.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/fightforthefuture/earth-day-live)

On April 22-24, the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, millions of people around the world are going online for a three-day mobilization to stop the climate emergency.

The event is named Earth Day Live, and this is the source code for Earth Day Live's widget that will allow anyone with a website to join the event in solidarity. [Click here to learn more.](https://earthdaylive2020.org)

This project was based on the [Digital Climate Strike widget](https://github.com/fightforthefuture/digital-climate-strike), which was used to black out thousands of websites last September, in support of what became the largest climate strike ever. Read about the results of the Digital Climate Strike [here](https://digital.globalclimatestrike.net/thanks/).

> Earth Day Live will mobilize millions to fight for the future of our planet.
